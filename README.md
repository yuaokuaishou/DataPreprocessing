- This code can be used as a test for model selection. Supported models include RandomForestRegressor, AdaBoostRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor, ExtraTreesRegressor, BaggingRegressor, KNeighborsRegressor, and SVR.

- The current code is for the house price prediction of melb dataset --- from Kaggle.

- Besides the prediction, this code can handle some simple data preprocessï¼Œsuch as Data Drop, Data Normalization, and Conversion from Text to Number.

- A variety of regression models have been installed from sklearn. The best is the ExtraTreesRegressor. It's prediction error can reach to 14.5% (Pretty Bad).
